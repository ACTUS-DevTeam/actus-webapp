Calendars have working and non-working days. A BDC value other than N means that cash flows cannot fall on non-working days, they must be shifted to the next business day (following) or the previous on (preceding).nThese two simple rules get refined twofold:n- Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then  it is shifted to preceding (following) business day.n- Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.nAttention: Does not affect non-cyclical dates such as PRD, MD, TD, IPCED since they can be set to the correct date directly.","Applicability":"x"},{"Group":"Calendar","Name":"EndOfMonthConvention","Type":"List","List":"some list","Description":"When computing schedules a special problem arises if an anchor date is at the end of a month and a cycle of monthly or quarterly is applied (yearly in the case of leap years only). How do we have to interpret an anchor date April 30 plus 1M cycles? In case where EOM is selected, it will jump to the 31st of May, then June 30, July 31 and so on. If SM is selected, it will jump to the 30st always with of course an exception in February. nThis logic applies for all months having 30 or less days and an anchor date at the last day. Month with 31 days will at any rate jump to the last of the month if anchor date is on the last day.","Applicability":"x"},{"Group":"Contract identification","Name":"ContractType","Type":"List","List":"some list","Description":"The ContractType is the most important information.
